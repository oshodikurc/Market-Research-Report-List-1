<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Sunblock Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Physical Sunblock</li><li>Chemical Sunblock</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The sunblock market is primarily divided into two categories: physical and chemical sunblocks. Physical sunblocks, also known as mineral sunblocks, contain active mineral ingredients like zinc oxide or titanium dioxide, providing a barrier that reflects UV rays. They are generally recommended for sensitive skin. On the other hand, chemical sunblocks absorb UV rays through synthetic compounds, such as avobenzone or octisalate, offering lightweight textures and easier application. Both types aim to protect skin from sun damage but differ in composition and application methods.</p></p>
